I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computing at the The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, advised by Prof. [Jing Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~jing1li/).
Before that, I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from Jilin University, where I was  supervised by Prof. [Yi Chang](http://yichang-cs.com/). During my graduate studies, I also work closely with Prof. [Lan Du](https://dulann.github.io/) from Monash University.
